# Project Overview

## This project is designed to ingest an excel template with origin/destination pairs and returns historical information in the database for each record in the excel template.  

###     Each lane is compared to hundreds of thousands of historical records grabbing only records within 50 miles of the origin and 50 miles of the destination

###     For each lane, historical cost average and load count is returned for each of the previous 4 full quarters, the current quarter-to-date, and a 1-year window as well.

###     Designed to assist with multi-lane RFQ requests so the pricing team can more effectively process the request.
